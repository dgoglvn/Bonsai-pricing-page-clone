# Bonsai-pricing-page-clone

I recreated the Bonsai pricing page and added some small differences.
I saw this project on frontendpractice.com and wanted to test my skills.

While working on this project, I learned about:
<ul>
  <li>pricing layouts</li>
  <li>toggle switches</li>
  <li>dropdowns</li>
  <li>accordions</li>
  <li>sticky footer</li>
